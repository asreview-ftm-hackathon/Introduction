## Repositories

### Set-up of this GitHub organization
In this GitHub organization you can find the following repositories:
- [Introduction](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Introduction): The repository where you are right now ðŸ˜Š. Here you can find this readme, the code of conduct and more information for each of the tracks.
  - [Data pre-processing](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Introduction/blob/main/track-information.md#track-1-data-pre-processing)
  - [Visualization](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Introduction/blob/main/track-information.md#track-2-visualization)
  - [Smart screening](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Introduction/blob/main/track-information.md#track-3-smart-screening)
- [Data](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Data): Containing both raw and basic pre-processed data and the data split into 10 smaller parts (more info on each in the README of this repository). 
- [Example for data pre-processing track](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Example-for-data-pre-processing-track): One of our researchers, [Jelle Teijema]() already did some pre-processing to create the basic pre-processed dataset for the visualization track (see data repository for the dataset itself). Take a look at his work for inspiration.
- [Example for visualization track](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Example-for-visualization-track): Not sure where to start for this track? Take a look at this repository for inspiration!
