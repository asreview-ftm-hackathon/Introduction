# Code of conduct

*This code of conduct is a slightly adapted version from the [hack code of conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/index.html)*.
 
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, 
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately.
 
Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing 
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
 
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, 
expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and lecture venues and hackathon-related social events.
